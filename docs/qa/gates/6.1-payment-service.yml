  - id: "stripe-customer-creation"
    severity: "HIGH"
    finding: "Customer creation in Stripe service is not properly integrated with user management"
    suggested_action: "Add customer creation/retrieval logic in payment service to ensure Stripe customers are created for users"
    category: "integration"
  
  - id: "error-handling-consistency"
    severity: "MEDIUM"
    finding: "Error handling patterns are inconsistent across handlers - some use different error response formats"
    suggested_action: "Standardize error response format across all handlers using a common error handler middleware"
    category: "maintainability"
  
  - id: "test-coverage-gaps"
    severity: "MEDIUM"
    finding: "Repository and service layer tests are missing - only model tests are present"
    suggested_action: "Add comprehensive unit tests for repositories, services, and handlers to achieve 90%+ coverage"
    category: "testing"
  
  - id: "webhook-security"
    severity: "MEDIUM"
    finding: "Webhook signature verification is implemented but error handling for invalid signatures could be improved"
    suggested_action: "Add proper error logging and monitoring for webhook signature verification failures"
    category: "security"
  
  - id: "database-constraints"
    severity: "LOW"
    finding: "Some database constraints could be more restrictive (e.g., exp_year should be dynamic, not hardcoded to 2024)"
    suggested_action: "Update database constraints to be more flexible and future-proof"
