#### Server Product Requirements Document (Server PRD)

#### 1. Introduction
This document specifies the server-side requirements for **zviewer**, the cross-platform multimedia browsing application. The server solution will be the core engine for managing user data, multimedia content, and all business logic, ensuring a seamless experience across all client platforms.

#### 2. Core Server Responsibilities
The server's primary responsibilities include:
* Securely storing and serving multimedia files (images and videos).
* Managing user accounts, authentication, and profiles.
* Handling all user-generated content, such as comments.
* Processing payments and managing subscription data.
* Providing administrative tools for content and user management.

#### 3. Functional Requirements

* **Authentication API:** The server must provide secure endpoints for user registration, login, and session management. This should support email/password and potentially third-party authentication methods.
* **Media API:** Endpoints for uploading, retrieving, and streaming multimedia content. This API must handle both image and video formats efficiently and support pagination for browsing.
* **Comments API:** Endpoints for posting, retrieving, editing, and deleting user comments on specific media items.
* **Payment API:** Secure endpoints to integrate with a payment gateway, handle transactions, and manage user subscription statuses.
* **User Management API:** Administrative endpoints for creating, updating, and deleting user accounts, as well as managing user roles and permissions.
* **Content Management API:** Administrative endpoints for moderating, curating, and organizing multimedia content, including the ability to flag inappropriate content.

#### 4. Non-Functional Requirements
* **Scalability:** The server must be distributed and autoscaled to handle a large number of concurrent users and a high volume of multimedia content, as the target audience is "everyone on the internet."
* **Availability:** The service must be highly available with minimal downtime.
* **Performance:** APIs should have low latency for a smooth user experience.
* **Security:** All user data, including passwords and payment information, must be handled securely with appropriate encryption and access controls.
