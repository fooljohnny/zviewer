#### UX Design Specification: zviewer

#### 1. Design Principles

* **Simplicity and Clarity**: The interface will remain clean, with content as the main focus. Through streamlined navigation and a minimalist design, users can focus on the pictures and videos themselves.
* **Cross-Platform Consistency**: Whether on the web, Android, iOS, or desktop applications, users will experience a consistent visual language and interaction patterns. This helps reduce the learning curve and builds user trust.
* **Responsive Design**: The layout will intelligently adapt to different screen sizes and device orientations, ensuring an optimal browsing experience whether the user is on a mobile phone, tablet, or large monitor.

#### 2. Key User Flows & Wireframes

**a. Media Browsing Flow for Unauthenticated Users**

1.  **Landing Page**: Users will see a waterfall or grid of the latest or most popular content upon arrival. This list supports infinite scrolling for continuous browsing.
2.  **Content Viewer**: Tapping on any thumbnail enters full-screen mode.
    * **Image Viewer**: Displays the full image with only the most essential controls.
    * **Video Player**: Provides standard play/pause, volume, progress bar, and full-screen toggle functions.
3.  **Comments Section**: Below the media viewer, users can view existing comments. This area can be collapsed or hidden to keep the interface tidy.

**b. User Authentication Flow**

1.  **Login/Signup**: Prominent login and signup entry points are available in the top navigation bar or menu.
2.  **Login Form**: Provides standard email/password login and integrates third-party login options (e.g., Google, Facebook) for user convenience.
3.  **Signup Form**: A simple form to collect email, password, and a username.
4.  **Profile Page**: After logging in, users can access their exclusive page to manage personal information, view uploaded content, favorited media, etc.

**c. Payment Flow**

1.  **Subscription/Payment Page**: A dedicated page that clearly displays payment options, such as a monthly subscription or a one-time purchase.
2.  **Payment Form**: A secure form for collecting credit card or third-party payment information.
3.  **Confirmation Page**: After the transaction is complete, a success message is displayed to reassure the user.

**d. Content and User Management (Admin)**

1.  **Admin Dashboard**: A separate, protected backend interface.
2.  **Content Management**: Administrators can review, approve, reject, and delete uploaded pictures and videos. Search and filter functions are provided for easy management.
3.  **User Management**: Administrators can view all user information and manage their permissions, such as banning accounts that violate rules.

#### 3. Key Interaction Points

* **Infinite Scrolling**: On content lists, when users scroll to the bottom of the page, more content is automatically loaded to provide a seamless browsing experience.
* **Gesture Interactions**: On mobile and tablet devices, users can swipe left and right to switch between pictures or videos in the full-screen viewer.
* **Hover States**: On the desktop, when the mouse hovers over clickable elements (such as thumbnails, buttons), there will be clear visual feedback.
* **Loading Indicators**: When content is loading, a clear loading animation or skeleton screen will be displayed to prevent user confusion from waiting.
