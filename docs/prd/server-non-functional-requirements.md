# Server Non-Functional Requirements

* **Scalability:** The server must be distributed and autoscaled to handle a large number of concurrent users and a high volume of multimedia content, as the target audience is "everyone on the internet."
* **Availability:** The service must be highly available with minimal downtime.
* **Performance:** APIs should have low latency for a smooth user experience.
* **Security:** All user data, including passwords and payment information, must be handled securely with appropriate encryption and access controls.
