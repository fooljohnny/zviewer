# Story 1.1: Basic Multimedia Viewer Setup

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to view images and videos in a basic multimedia viewer,
**so that** I can consume multimedia content on the platform

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A basic multimedia viewer component is created that can display images
2. A basic multimedia viewer component is created that can display videos
3. The viewer supports touch gestures for mobile devices (pinch to zoom, pan)
4. The viewer supports mouse interactions for desktop (scroll wheel zoom, click and drag to pan)
5. The viewer provides smooth and responsive experience across all supported platforms
6. Basic navigation between different media items is implemented
7. The viewer handles different image formats (JPEG, PNG, WebP)
8. The viewer handles different video formats (MP4, WebM)
9. Loading states are shown while media is being loaded
10. Error states are handled gracefully when media fails to load

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
This is the first story in the project, so no previous story context is available.

### Data Models
No specific data models are required for this basic viewer setup. The viewer will work with local media files initially.

### API Specifications
No API integration is required for this story. The viewer will work with local media files.

### Component Specifications
**ImageViewer Widget:**
- Should support common image formats (JPEG, PNG, WebP)
- Must handle touch gestures (pinch to zoom, pan)
- Must handle mouse interactions (scroll wheel zoom, click and drag)
- Should show loading states while images load
- Should handle error states gracefully

**VideoViewer Widget:**
- Should support common video formats (MP4, WebM)
- Must handle touch gestures (pinch to zoom, pan)
- Must handle mouse interactions (scroll wheel zoom, click and drag)
- Should show loading states while videos load
- Should handle error states gracefully
- Should provide basic video controls (play/pause, seek)
