## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Authentication system is fully implemented with Provider pattern
- User model and authentication state management are available
- Secure token storage and API service patterns are established
- Form validation patterns and error handling are implemented
- Cross-platform compatibility is maintained

### Data Models
**Comment Model** (to be created):
```dart
class Comment {
  final String id;
  final String content;
  final String authorId;
  final String authorName;
  final String mediaId;
  final DateTime createdAt;
  final DateTime? updatedAt;
}
```
[Source: architecture/server-microservice-breakdown.md#Comments Service]

### API Specifications
**Comments Endpoints** (to be implemented):
- `POST /api/comments` - Create new comment
- `GET /api/comments/{mediaId}` - Get comments for specific media
- `PUT /api/comments/{commentId}` - Update comment (if needed)
- `DELETE /api/comments/{commentId}` - Delete comment (if needed)
[Source: architecture/server-functional-requirements.md#Comments API]

**Request/Response Format**:
- Post Comment: `{content: string, mediaId: string}` → `{id: string, content: string, authorId: string, authorName: string, mediaId: string, createdAt: string}`
- Get Comments: `GET /api/comments/{mediaId}` → `{comments: Comment[]}`
[Source: architecture/frontend-data-flow.md#User Data]

### Component Specifications
**Comment Input Component**:
- Text input field for comment content
- Submit button with loading state
- Character limit validation
- Disabled state for non-authenticated users
- Error message display area

**Comment List Component**:
- Scrollable list of comments
- Chronological ordering (newest first)
- Loading indicator during data fetch
- Empty state when no comments exist
- Error state for failed API calls

**Comment Item Component**:
- Author name display
- Comment content display
- Timestamp formatting
- Proper text wrapping and styling

### File Locations
Based on current project structure:
- `lib/models/comment.dart` - Comment data model
- `lib/services/comment_service.dart` - Comment API service
- `lib/providers/comment_provider.dart` - Comment state management
- `lib/widgets/comments/comment_input.dart` - Comment input widget

### Testing Requirements
**Test File Location**: `test/` directory following existing pattern
**Test Standards**: 
- Unit tests for all service methods
- Widget tests for all UI components
- Integration tests for comment flow
- Mock API responses for testing
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md#Testing Structure]

**Testing Frameworks**:

### Technical Constraints
- Flutter SDK: >=3.0.0 <4.0.0
- Cross-platform compatibility required (web, mobile, desktop)
- HTTP client for API communication
- Form validation using Flutter form validation
- Authentication integration required
[Source: architecture/frontend-technology-stack.md]

### Security Considerations
- Comments only accessible to authenticated users
- Input sanitization and validation
- HTTPS required for all API calls
