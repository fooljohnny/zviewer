 # Story 5.1: Comments Service Implementation

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to implement the Comments Service microservice with full CRUD operations for user comments on media content,
**so that** users can post, view, edit, and delete comments on multimedia content with proper authentication and data validation

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A Comments Service microservice is created with proper Go project structure following existing patterns
2. Comment data models and database schema are implemented with proper relationships to users and media items
3. REST API endpoints are implemented for all comment operations (create, read, update, delete)
4. Authentication integration with existing User Service JWT middleware is implemented
5. Comment validation and business logic are implemented (content length, profanity filtering, etc.)
6. Comment pagination and filtering functionality is implemented
7. Comment threading/replies functionality is implemented
8. Integration with Media Service for content validation is implemented
9. Comprehensive error handling and logging are implemented
10. Unit tests are created for all comment service functionality
11. API documentation is generated and available
12. Database migrations are created for comment tables
13. Comment moderation capabilities are implemented
14. Comment statistics and analytics endpoints are implemented

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- User Service and Media Service are already implemented and operational
- JWT authentication middleware pattern is established in existing services
- Database connection and migration patterns are established
- Docker containerization and service discovery patterns are in place
- API documentation generation using existing patterns

### Data Models
**Comment Model Structure:**
- ID: UUID primary key
- UserID: Foreign key to users table (UUID)
- MediaItemID: Foreign key to media_items table (UUID) 
- ParentID: Optional foreign key for threaded comments (UUID, nullable)
- Content: Text content of the comment (max 1000 characters)
- Status: Comment status (active, deleted, moderated, pending)
- CreatedAt: Timestamp
- UpdatedAt: Timestamp
- DeletedAt: Soft delete timestamp (nullable)

### API Specifications
**Base URL:** `/api/v1/comments`

**Endpoints:**
- `POST /` - Create new comment (requires authentication)
- `GET /` - List comments with pagination and filtering
- `GET /{id}` - Get specific comment by ID

- `DELETE /{id}` - Soft delete comment (owner or admin)
- `GET /media/{mediaId}` - Get comments for specific media item
- `POST /{id}/reply` - Reply to comment (threading)
- `GET /{id}/replies` - Get replies to comment
- `GET /stats` - Get comment statistics (admin only)

**Request/Response Format:**
- Standard JSON API format
- Pagination: `?page=1&limit=20&sort=created_at&order=desc`
- Filtering: `?status=active&user_id=uuid&media_id=uuid`

### Component Specifications
**Service Architecture:**
- Repository pattern for data access
- Service layer for business logic
- Handler layer for HTTP request/response

The Comments Service follows the established microservice pattern used by the existing User Service and Media Service. The service will be deployed as a separate container and communicate with other services via HTTP APIs. The database schema includes proper foreign key relationships to maintain data integrity across services.
