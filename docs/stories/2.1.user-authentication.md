# Story 2.1: User Authentication

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to log in to my account,
**so that** I can access personalized features and secure content

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A login form is created with email and password fields
2. A registration form is created with email, password, and confirm password fields
3. Form validation is implemented for all input fields
4. Secure authentication API calls are made to the backend
5. User session is maintained after successful login
6. Login/logout state is reflected in the UI
7. Error messages are displayed for invalid credentials
8. Loading states are shown during authentication requests
9. The authentication flow works on all supported platforms (web, mobile, desktop)
10. Password requirements are enforced (minimum 8 characters, special characters)

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
- Flutter project structure is established with modular widget organization
- Provider pattern is available for state management
- Testing framework is set up with comprehensive widget tests
- Cross-platform support is working (Windows platform confirmed)

### Data Models
**User Model** (to be created):
```dart
class User {
  final String id;
  final String email;
  final String? displayName;
  final DateTime createdAt;
  final DateTime? lastLoginAt;
}
```
[Source: architecture/server-microservice-breakdown.md#User Service]

**Authentication Response** (to be created):
```dart
class AuthResponse {
  final String token;
  final User user;
  final DateTime expiresAt;
}
```

### API Specifications
**Authentication Endpoints** (to be implemented):
- `POST /api/auth/login` - User login with email/password
- `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration
- `POST /api/auth/logout` - User logout
- `GET /api/auth/me` - Get current user profile
[Source: architecture/server-functional-requirements.md#Authentication API]

**Request/Response Format**:
- Login: `{email: string, password: string}` → `{token: string, user: User}`
- Register: `{email: string, password: string, confirmPassword: string}` → `{token: string, user: User}`
[Source: architecture/frontend-data-flow.md#User Data]

### Component Specifications
**Login Form Component**:
- Email input field with validation
- Password input field with validation
- Login button with loading state
- Error message display area
- Navigation to registration form

**Registration Form Component**:
- Email input field with validation
- Password input field with strength indicator
- Confirm password field with matching validation
- Register button with loading state
- Error message display area
- Navigation to login form

**Auth Screen Component**:
- Tab-based navigation between login/register
- Form switching functionality
- Loading overlay for auth requests
- Error message display system

### File Locations
Based on current project structure:
- `lib/services/auth_service.dart` - Authentication API service
- `lib/providers/auth_provider.dart` - Authentication state management
- `lib/widgets/auth/login_form.dart` - Login form widget
- `lib/widgets/auth/register_form.dart` - Registration form widget
- `lib/widgets/auth/auth_screen.dart` - Main authentication screen
- `lib/models/user.dart` - User data model
- `lib/models/auth_response.dart` - Authentication response model
- `test/services/auth_service_test.dart` - Auth service tests
- `test/widgets/auth/` - Auth widget tests

### Testing Requirements
**Test File Location**: `test/` directory following existing pattern
**Test Standards**: 
- Unit tests for all service methods
- Widget tests for all UI components
- Integration tests for authentication flow
- Mock API responses for testing
[Source: architecture/source-tree.md#Testing Structure]

**Testing Frameworks**:
- `flutter_test` for unit and widget tests
- Mock objects for API service testing
- Test data factories for User and AuthResponse models

### Technical Constraints
- Flutter SDK: >=3.0.0 <4.0.0
- Cross-platform compatibility required (web, mobile, desktop)
- Secure token storage using Flutter secure storage
- HTTP client for API communication
- Form validation using Flutter form validation
[Source: architecture/frontend-technology-stack.md]

### Security Considerations
- Password hashing handled by backend
- JWT token storage in secure storage
- HTTPS required for all API calls
- Input sanitization and validation
[Source: architecture/server-functional-requirements.md#Authentication API]

## Testing

### Test File Location
- `test/services/auth_service_test.dart` - Authentication service tests

- `test/widgets/auth/auth_screen_test.dart` - Auth screen widget tests
- `test/providers/auth_provider_test.dart` - Auth provider state tests

### Test Standards
- Unit tests for all service methods with mocked API responses
- Widget tests for form validation and user interactions
- Integration tests for complete authentication flow
- Mock objects for API service and secure storage
- Test data factories for consistent test data creation

### Testing Frameworks and Patterns
- `flutter_test` for unit and widget testing
- `mockito` for creating mock objects
- `provider` testing utilities for state management tests
- Custom test helpers for form validation testing

### Specific Testing Requirements
- Test email format validation with various input scenarios
- Test password strength validation with different password types
- Test API error handling and network failure scenarios
- Test authentication state persistence across app restarts
- Test cross-platform form behavior and validation
