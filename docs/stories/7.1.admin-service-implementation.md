4. Role-based access control is implemented with proper permission validation
5. Content moderation functionality is implemented with flagging and review capabilities
6. System statistics and reporting endpoints are implemented for platform oversight
7. Bulk operations are implemented for efficient content and user management
8. Audit logging is implemented for all administrative actions
9. Integration with existing services (User, Media, Comments, Payment) is implemented
10. Comprehensive error handling and logging are implemented
11. Unit tests are created for all admin service functionality
12. API documentation is generated and available
13. Database migrations are created for admin-specific tables
14. Security measures and access controls are implemented
15. Integration with existing authentication and authorization systems is implemented

## Project Structure Notes
The Admin Service follows the established microservice pattern used by the existing services. The service will be deployed as a separate container and communicate with other services via HTTP APIs. The database schema includes proper foreign key relationships to maintain data integrity across services. Admin functionality is designed to provide comprehensive platform management capabilities while maintaining security and audit compliance.
