# Story 6.1: Payment Service Implementation

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to implement the Payment Service microservice with secure payment processing, subscription management, and transaction handling,
**so that** users can make payments for premium content and subscriptions with proper security and data integrity

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A Payment Service microservice is created with proper Go project structure following existing patterns
2. Payment data models and database schema are implemented with proper relationships to users
3. REST API endpoints are implemented for all payment operations (create, read, update, delete)
4. Authentication integration with existing User Service JWT middleware is implemented
5. Payment gateway integration (Stripe) is implemented for secure transaction processing
6. Subscription management functionality is implemented with recurring billing support
7. Payment method management (save, update, delete) is implemented
8. Transaction history and reporting functionality is implemented
9. Webhook handling for payment gateway events is implemented
10. Comprehensive error handling and logging are implemented
11. Unit tests are created for all payment service functionality
12. API documentation is generated and available
13. Database migrations are created for payment tables
14. Payment security and PCI compliance measures are implemented
15. Integration with existing services (User Service, Media Service) is implemented

## Project Structure Notes
The Payment Service follows the established microservice pattern used by the existing User Service, Media Service, and Comments Service. The service will be deployed as a separate container and communicate with other services via HTTP APIs. The database schema includes proper foreign key relationships to maintain data integrity across services. Payment data handling follows PCI compliance requirements with sensitive data stored securely in Stripe.
