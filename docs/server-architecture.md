#### Server Architecture: zviewer

#### 1. Architectural Approach
The server architecture will follow a **microservices-based approach** running on a **cloud-native platform**. This design pattern ensures the system is distributed, highly scalable, and resilient, meeting the requirements for handling a massive global audience and diverse functionalities.

#### 2. Technology Stack

* **Programming Language:** **Go (Golang)**.
    * **Justification:** Go is an excellent choice for building performant, concurrent, and scalable backend services. It is well-suited for I/O-heavy applications like a multimedia streaming server and is natively compiled, providing great performance.

* **Web Framework:** **Go's standard library** or a lightweight framework like **Gin**.
    * **Justification:** These provide a minimalistic and efficient way to build RESTful APIs without unnecessary overhead, allowing for fine-grained control over performance.

* **Database:**
    * **User/Metadata Database:** **PostgreSQL** or a similar relational database.
        * **Justification:** A relational database is ideal for managing structured data like user profiles, comments, and payment information, ensuring data integrity and consistency.
    * **Media Indexing:** **Elasticsearch**.
        * **Justification:** For advanced search and content discovery, Elasticsearch provides a powerful and scalable solution for indexing and searching metadata about multimedia files.

* **File Storage:** **Amazon S3 (or similar cloud object storage)** and **local disk storage**.
    * **Justification:** The system will be designed to support both. S3 provides a highly available, scalable, and durable solution for cloud storage, while local storage can be used for caching or for users who prefer on-premise solutions.

* **Deployment and Orchestration:** **Kubernetes (K8s)**.
    * **Justification:** Kubernetes is the industry standard for orchestrating containerized applications. It will enable the "autoscaled" and "distributed" requirements, automatically managing the deployment, scaling, and load balancing of the microservices.

* **API Gateway:** A service like **Envoy** or **Kong**.
    * **Justification:** An API Gateway will manage and route all incoming requests to the correct microservice, handle security, rate limiting, and other cross-cutting concerns.

#### 3. Microservice Breakdown

The backend will be broken down into distinct microservices:

* **User Service:** Manages user registration, login, profiles, and authentication.
* **Media Service:** Handles multimedia uploads, processing, and streaming. It will interact with both cloud and local storage systems.
* **Comments Service:** Manages the creation, storage, and retrieval of user comments.
* **Payment Service:** A dedicated service for all payment-related transactions and subscriptions.
* **Admin Service:** Provides the API for the admin dashboard, including content moderation and user management.

This architecture ensures that each part of the system can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently, providing the flexibility and robustness required for a project of this scope.
