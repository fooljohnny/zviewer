# Frontend Technology Stack

* **Core Framework:** **Flutter**.
    * **Justification:** Flutter is a UI toolkit from Google for building beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. Its performance is excellent, and it provides a rich set of widgets and tools that will accelerate development. This aligns perfectly with the need for a unified solution for all client platforms.

* **State Management:** **Provider** or **Riverpod**.
    * **Justification:** These are reactive, scalable state management solutions for Flutter. They are widely used and well-documented, making it easy to manage the complex state required for a multimedia application (e.g., video playback state, user authentication status, comments data).

* **Routing:** **GoRouter**.
    * **Justification:** GoRouter is a declarative routing package for Flutter that makes navigation simple and flexible. It can handle complex deep linking and is ideal for managing the different views outlined in the UI/UX specification (e.g., the main browsing grid, the full-screen media viewer, the user profile page).

* **UI Components:** **Custom Widget Library**.
    * **Justification:** While Flutter's built-in widgets are extensive, a custom widget library will be developed to ensure a consistent and unique "zviewer" design language, as outlined in the UI/UX spec. This will include components for the media viewer, comment section, and user management dashboards.
