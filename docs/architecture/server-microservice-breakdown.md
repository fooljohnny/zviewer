# Server Microservice Breakdown

The backend will be broken down into distinct microservices:

* **User Service:** Manages user registration, login, profiles, and authentication.
* **Media Service:** Handles multimedia uploads, processing, and streaming. It will interact with both cloud and local storage systems.
* **Comments Service:** Manages the creation, storage, and retrieval of user comments.
* **Payment Service:** A dedicated service for all payment-related transactions and subscriptions.
* **Admin Service:** Provides the API for the admin dashboard, including content moderation and user management.

This architecture ensures that each part of the system can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently, providing the flexibility and robustness required for a project of this scope.
