# Frontend Data Flow

* **Media Content:** The frontend will fetch multimedia content from the backend server via a RESTful API or GraphQL endpoint. Content will be streamed or loaded on demand to optimize performance and bandwidth usage.
* **User Data:** User authentication (login, signup) will be handled via secure API calls. User profiles and comments will be managed through dedicated API endpoints.
* **Payment Integration:** A secure client-side SDK from a payment provider (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) will be integrated to handle payment transactions without compromising sensitive user data.
