# Server Technology Stack

* **Programming Language:** **Go (Golang)**.
    * **Justification:** Go is an excellent choice for building performant, concurrent, and scalable backend services. It is well-suited for I/O-heavy applications like a multimedia streaming server and is natively compiled, providing great performance.

* **Web Framework:** **Go's standard library** or a lightweight framework like **Gin**.
    * **Justification:** These provide a minimalistic and efficient way to build RESTful APIs without unnecessary overhead, allowing for fine-grained control over performance.

* **Database:**
    * **User/Metadata Database:** **PostgreSQL** or a similar relational database.
        * **Justification:** A relational database is ideal for managing structured data like user profiles, comments, and payment information, ensuring data integrity and consistency.
    * **Media Indexing:** **Elasticsearch**.
        * **Justification:** For advanced search and content discovery, Elasticsearch provides a powerful and scalable solution for indexing and searching metadata about multimedia files.

* **File Storage:** **Amazon S3 (or similar cloud object storage)** and **local disk storage**.
    * **Justification:** The system will be designed to support both. S3 provides a highly available, scalable, and durable solution for cloud storage, while local storage can be used for caching or for users who prefer on-premise solutions.

* **Deployment and Orchestration:** **Kubernetes (K8s)**.
    * **Justification:** Kubernetes is the industry standard for orchestrating containerized applications. It will enable the "autoscaled" and "distributed" requirements, automatically managing the deployment, scaling, and load balancing of the microservices.

* **API Gateway:** A service like **Envoy** or **Kong**.
    * **Justification:** An API Gateway will manage and route all incoming requests to the correct microservice, handle security, rate limiting, and other cross-cutting concerns.
