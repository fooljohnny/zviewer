# ZViewer UI/UX Specification

## Introduction

This document defines the user experience goals, information architecture, user flows, and visual design specifications for ZViewer's user interface. It serves as the foundation for visual design and frontend development, ensuring a cohesive and user-centered experience.

### Overall UX Goals & Principles

#### Target User Personas

**Multimedia Enthusiast:** Users who enjoy viewing and sharing photos, videos, and other media content. They value visual appeal, smooth interactions, and social features like comments.

**Content Creator:** Professional or amateur creators who need to organize, manage, and showcase their multimedia content. They require efficient browsing, categorization, and management tools.

**Social Viewer:** Users who primarily consume content and engage through comments and interactions. They prioritize discovery, easy navigation, and engaging visual experiences.

#### Usability Goals

- **Visual Immersion:** Users should feel immersed in their multimedia content with beautiful, distraction-free viewing experiences
- **Intuitive Navigation:** New users can discover and navigate content within 30 seconds
- **Efficient Browsing:** Power users can quickly find and view specific content through smart organization
- **Social Engagement:** Users can easily view and interact with comments without disrupting their viewing experience
- **Performance:** Smooth 60fps animations and sub-200ms response times for all interactions

#### Design Principles

1. **Visual First** - Prioritize the multimedia content as the hero element in every interface
2. **Glassmorphism Aesthetic** - Use Apple-inspired frosted glass effects for modern, elegant backgrounds
3. **Fluid Interactions** - Smooth animations and transitions that feel natural and responsive
4. **Progressive Disclosure** - Show relevant information when needed, hide complexity when not
5. **Social Integration** - Seamlessly integrate comments and social features without cluttering the viewing experience

    A[Authentication] --> B[Main Gallery]
    A --> C[Registration]
    B --> D[Media Detail View]
    B --> E[User Profile]
    B --> F[Settings]
    D --> G[Comment Overlay]
    D --> H[Media Controls]
    E --> I[Account Settings]
    E --> J[Content Management]
    F --> K[Display Preferences]
    F --> L[Comment Settings]
```

### Navigation Structure

**Primary Navigation:** Bottom tab bar with Gallery, Profile, and Settings icons for easy thumb navigation

**Secondary Navigation:** Contextual actions within each screen (search, filter, sort options)

**Breadcrumb Strategy:** Simple back navigation with media count indicators (e.g., "Photo 3 of 15")

## User Flows

### Flow 1: First-time User Onboarding

**User Goal:** Create account and explore multimedia content

**Entry Points:** App launch, registration screen

**Success Criteria:** User successfully creates account and views their first media item

#### Flow Diagram

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[App Launch] --> B[Welcome Screen]
    B --> C[Registration Form]
    C --> D[Email Verification]
    D --> E[Profile Setup]
    E --> F[Gallery Overview]
    F --> G[First Media View]
```

#### Edge Cases & Error Handling:
- Network connectivity issues during registration
- Invalid email format validation
- Account already exists error handling
- Profile setup incomplete scenarios

**Notes:** Focus on minimal friction while gathering essential user information

### Flow 2: Media Discovery and Viewing

**User Goal:** Browse and view multimedia content efficiently

**Entry Points:** Gallery screen, search results, shared links

**Success Criteria:** User can quickly find and view desired content with smooth interactions

#### Flow Diagram

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Gallery View] --> B[Scroll/Filter Content]
    B --> C[Tap Media Item]
    C --> D[Detail View Opens]
    D --> E[View Media with Comments]
    E --> F[Navigate to Next/Previous]
    F --> E
    E --> G[Close Detail View]
    G --> A
```

#### Edge Cases & Error Handling:
- Large media files loading slowly
- Network interruptions during viewing
- Comment loading failures
- Media format not supported

**Notes:** Prioritize smooth transitions and provide clear loading states

### Flow 3: Comment Interaction

**User Goal:** View and interact with comments on media content

**Entry Points:** Media detail view, comment notifications

#### Flow Diagram

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Media Detail View] --> B[Comments Toggle On/Off]
    B --> C[Comments Overlay Active]
    C --> D[View Floating Comments]
    D --> E[Add New Comment]
    E --> F[Comment Appears as Overlay]
    F --> D
    C --> G[Comments Toggle Off]
    G --> H[Clean Media View]
```

#### Edge Cases & Error Handling:
- Comment posting failures
- Inappropriate comment moderation
- Comment loading timeouts
- Real-time comment sync issues

**Notes:** Comments should enhance, not distract from the viewing experience
